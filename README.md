# Simple Sudoku Solver
A simple sudoku solver implementing a few solving methods:

- Naked singles,
- hidden singles,
- naked tuples (pairs, triples, etc)
- hidden tuples (idem)
- pointing tuples (pairs or triple, by necessity)
- x-wing
- y-wing

This solver doesn't necessarily solve a sudoku completely since these methods aren't always enough, but it does not attempt to bruteforce the puzzle.
